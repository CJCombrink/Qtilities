          \brief The ProcessBufferMessageTypeHint structure is used to define custom hints for process buffer message processing in QtilitiesProcess.

          A ProcessBufferMessageTypeHint contains the following information:
          - The regular expression matched to the single message line after processing has been done by QtilitiesProcess (see \ref qtilities_process_buffering).
          - The message type to assign to matched messages.
          - A priority for the match. If multiple hints match a message, the hint with the highest priority wil be used to log the message. If multiple hints match which have the same priority, the message will be linked using multiple times (where each logged message will be logged using the type specified by the applicable matching hint).

        \class QtilitiesProcess
        \brief An easy to use way to launch external processes through an extended wrapper around QProcess.

        The QtilitiesProcess class simplifies usage of QProcess and provides ready to use logging and task integration capablities.

        When logging is enabled, QtilitiesProcess will automatically log all \p stdout and \p stderr outputs in a logger engine.
        It takes care of splitting up messages received from the QProcess buffer for you, thus individual messages are logged to the
        logger engine.

        \section qtilities_process_buffering Buffering of process buffers

        When the read_process_buffers parameter in the QtilitiesProcess constructor is enabled, the
        process buffers of the backend QProcess will be processed. Processed messages
        will be emitted using newStandardErrorMessage() and newStandardErrorMessage(), and if the enable_logging
        parameter in the QtilitiesProcess was enabled, the processed messages will also be logged to the task
        representing the process.

        If read_process_buffers is false, the process buffer won't be touched and you can manually access it
        through the internal QIODevice exposed through the process() function.

        Processing of messages allows QtilitiesProcess to properly log messages received from the backend process
        using the %Qtilities logger. In many cases, messages received from the QIODevice used by QProcess are not nicely
        formatted. For example, readyReadStandardOutput() and readyReadStandardError() aren't emitted once for every message.
        They will normally be emitted with a buffered message which needs to be split up in order to identify individual messages.
        That is the goal of process buffering in QtilitiesProcess.

        \subsection qtilities_process_buffering_default Default buffer processing

        Default buffer processing is done when no line break strings are set which helps the processing logic
        to know which strings can be used to split up the individual messages. That is, when lineBreakStrings() is empty which
        is the default. The next section covers the case where custom line break strings have been set, enabling
        proper logging of process messages in more complicated situations.

        During default buffer processing, the process buffer is split into individual messages using a search for the
        new line character ("\n"). The text in the QStringList resulting from the split is then handled as individual messages.
        By default these individual messages are logged as normal info messages. However, using setProcessBufferMessageTypeHint() it
        is possible to classify these individual messages as different types of messages. For example, if the backend process
        starts error messages with "ERROR:", it is possible to add a process buffer message type hint using
        the following regular expression:

\code
QRegExp reg_exp_error = QRegExp(QObject::tr("ERROR:") + "*",Qt::CaseInsensitive,QRegExp::Wildcard);
ProcessBufferMessageTypeHint message_hint_error(reg_exp_error,Logger::Error);
my_process.addProcessBufferMessageTypeHint(message_hint_error);
\endcode

        The processing logic will then know to log these messages as errors instead of normal information messages.

        \subsection qtilities_process_buffering_line_break_strings Custom line break processing

        Using setLineBreakStrings() it is possible to specify custom strings which are used to split the process buffer
        into individual messages. This extra functionality is required in cases where individual messages are split across
        multiple lines. For example, if an error message is split accross multiple line, the standard buffer processing logic
        will log the first line of the message as an error, and the next line as a normal information message.

        To solve this problem, custom line break strings can be provided in order to split messages not usign the line
        break character, but using any of the specified line break strings. In order for the processing logic to work
        properly, it is required that the backend process always provide data in a consitant way. For example, info messages
        must start with a known string, warnings with another known string and errors with another known string. These known
        strings can be set as the line break strings on the QtilitiesProcess and all text between these known strings will be logged
        as individual messages.
